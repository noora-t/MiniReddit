# MiniReddit

## Introduction

I created MiniReddit to practise making a single-page application with React. The goal was to recreate Reddit's main features.

The idea for the app came from CodeCademy's front-end developer course. All the code and visual style is designed and written by me.

## App Features

* Landing page with top posts
* Search
* Pages for each post

## Future Features

* Filter search results
* Sidebar that displays subreddit information
* A skeleton loading feature
* Show comments
* Search suggestions
* Show more posts
